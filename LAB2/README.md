Lab Exercise Question

You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:

Enter a name

Search for a name

Remove a name

Note:

The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.

Constraints:

The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.

The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!

Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.

Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!

Format your results properly!!
